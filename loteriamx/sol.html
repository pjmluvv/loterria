    <p>'El sol es un globo de fuego,
la luna es un disco morado.'</p>
<p>Sun of the Incas, Sun of the Mayas,
mature American sun,
sun in which Mayans and Quichés
recognized and worshipped,
and in which old Aymara
like amber were burned.
Red pheasant when you lift
and when you measure, white pheasant,
Sol Painter and Tattoo Artist
of the caste of a man and of a leopard.

Sun of mountains and valleys,
from the abysses and the plains,
Rafael of our marches,
golden hound of our steps,
On every land and every sea
holy and sign of my brothers.
If we get lost, let them look for us
in some scorched silts,
Where the breadfruit tree exists
and suffers from the balsam tree.The last-minute sun, which confuses
my colors in clear and divine light,
He caresses my books, sweetly.

What clear company
his; How it enlarges
the room, and converts it, fills,
in the valley, in the sky – Andalusia! -,
in childhood, in love!
