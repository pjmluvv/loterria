<p>Bring a pot with its flower.

I'm going to that flowery garden

to choose the best one.

In school I have learned

that must be cultivated with love,

The lesson today I have fulfilled

My little pot is a delight.

In your place I do not forget,

water is their obligatory food,

But my words are the incentive

that causes her blush

And it has given me the color

of the most beautiful flower.the good perfume of peppermint, 

and of good basil, 
that my mother had in her pots. 
That you saw me sink my pure hands 
In the still water, 
to reach the enchanted fruits 
that today at the bottom of the fountain they dream... 
Yes, I know you, happy and clear afternoon, 
almost spring.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
