<p>The Moon is a celestial body that has existed much longer than all of us, it has a purpose, but at the same time it only exists with us. Gliding through the velvet sky,
A silent witness to our lives' rush.
It casts its glow on lovers' dreams,
And bathes the world in silver beams.
With a purpose, it pulls the tides,
In its embrace, the ocean glides. Yet, at the same time, it only exists with us,
Our fleeting moments, our joys, and fuss.
In the cradle of night, it holds our fears,
Whispering secrets through the years.It watches over ages past,
From ancient times to shadows cast.
A guardian of stories, both bold and meek,
In its presence, we find what we seek.
So let us gaze upon its face,
And find in its light a sacred space.
For the Moon, though distant, is never alone,
In our hearts, it finds a home.</p><br><br><br>
