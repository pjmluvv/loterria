    <p>'Debe un corazon rabiar,
Nadie lo podrá juzgar
Sino aquel que lo ha probado.
Yo que en medio del favor'</p>
<p>Our hearts that developed along with us until we both started existing in this world, we blame it for so many things, our heartache, but itt always keeps beating for us.In the cradle of youth, it danced with delight,
Pulsing with laughter, igniting our dreams.
Through innocent moments, it soared to new heights,
A compass of hope in life’s flowing streams.Yet as we journeyed, the trials took shape,
With every loss, it learned to defend.
We burdened it with sorrow, a fragile drape,
Thinking our pain would be its end.It felt the weight of every goodbye,
The sting of betrayal, the chill of regret.
In shadows of night, it whispered a sigh,
Yet still, it beats on, refusing to fret.For our hearts are resilient, forged in the fire,
They carry our stories, both joyous and bleak.
Through heartbreak and healing, they never tire,
In the silence of moments, they silently speak.Each beat is a promise, a rhythm of life,
A reminder that love, though it may ache,
Is woven with threads of joy and strife,
In the tapestry of existence, we create.</p><br><br><br>
