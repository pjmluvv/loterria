Me protegiste del sol
y la lluvia'</p>
<p>You were always there for me
When I needed you

But now you're gone
And I'm alone.

I miss you
my little umbrella. 'Cause when it rains, I open my umbrella
To keep me dry and safe from moisture
I know I'll be alright
As long as I have my umbrella with me

He's my faithful friend in the storm
That keeps me from getting soaked
So when the rain falls
I'll be ready with my umbrella.A drop of rain falls
From the sky
Land on my nose
And I start crying

I wish I had an umbrella
To keep me dry
But all I got is this old broken thing
That barely holds up

The rain continues to fall
And I keep getting wet
But I don't care
I'm going to enjoy the weather

Even though I'm soaking wet
I'll still stay here
And smile

because umbrellas
They are too expensive</p><br><br><br><br>
